## TO DO:
- Current behaviour
  - Reader checked first --> successfully converts page (a bit slow-- page reloads 3 times in process?)
    - If you then check wsp ln --> styling applies briefly but then reverts to normal
  - Wsp ln checked first --> styling applies briefly but then reverts to normal
    - If you then check reader -->  reader successfully converts, wsp ln briefly applies on initial load but then reverts, page reloads 3 more times in process of styling (total reloads: 4), then finally wsp ln styling successfully loads and the application of the styling stays
